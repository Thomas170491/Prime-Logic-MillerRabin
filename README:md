Optimized Miller-Rabin Primality Test
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a high-performance implementation of the Miller-Rabin Primality Test, a probabilistic algorithm essential for modern cryptography. As a Mathematician transitioning into Cybersecurity, I developed this tool to demonstrate how advanced number theory is applied to secure digital communications, specifically in the generation of large primes for RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
🧪 Mathematical Context

The Miller-Rabin test is based on Fermat's Little Theorem and the property of square roots of unity in a finite field.

Given an odd integer n>3, we write n−1 as 2r⋅d, where d is odd. For a base a:

    If ad≡1(modn), n is a probable prime.

    If a2s⋅d≡−1(modn) for some 0≤s<r, n is a probable prime.

If neither holds, n is definitely composite. This implementation uses Modular Exponentiation to ensure O(klog3n) complexity, making it suitable for 2048-bit integer analysis.
🚀 Key Features

    Probabilistic Accuracy: Configurable accuracy through parameter k (default 40 trials), reducing the probability of error to less than 4−k.

    Optimized Performance: Utilizes Python's pow(a, d, n) for efficient binary exponentiation.

    Witness Discovery: Identifies composite numbers that fool the standard Fermat primality test (Carmichael numbers).
